## Presence Analytics

The backend processes time-stamped proximity logs to detect entry and exit events for individual wearables. These events enable:

- Calculation of personnel presence duration
- Identification of unauthorized exits or extended absence
- Detection of irregular movement patterns

Such analytics are critical for defense training facilities, drone operation zones, and restricted industrial environments where accountability and situational awareness are required.

The architecture is intentionally designed to support future encryption, role-based access control, and command-center integration.
