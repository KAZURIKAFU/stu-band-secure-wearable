# Stu-Band: Secure Low-Power Wearable for Personnel Monitoring

## Overview
STU-Band is a smart wearable system that automates attendance using proximity-based verification (BLE/NFC) while harvesting body heat through thermoelectric generators (TEGs) for ultra-low power operation.


## Problem Statement
Manual and proxy-based attendance systems fail in large campuses and defense training environments due to identity fraud, scalability issues, and power constraints in wearable devices.


## Solution
STU-Band is a smart wearable system that automates attendance using proximity-based verification (BLE/NFC) while harvesting body heat through thermoelectric generators (TEGs) for ultra-low power operation.



## System Architecture
- Wearable Band with TEG for passive energy harvesting
- Proximity sensing using BLE/NFC
- Data ingestion and session logging backend
