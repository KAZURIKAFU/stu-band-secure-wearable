# Stu-Band: Secure Low-Power Wearable for Personnel Monitoring

## Overview
Stu-Band is a low-power wearable system designed for secure personnel identification and zone presence monitoring in defense and industrial environments. The system leverages BLE communication, proximity sensing, and a Python-based backend to log, validate, and analyze presence data.

## Problem Statement
Defense and industrial facilities require reliable, low-maintenance solutions for personnel tracking. Existing methods are power-intensive, infrastructure-heavy, or manually operated, leading to inefficiencies and security gaps.

## Solution
The backend includes presence analytics that identify entry and exit events and support anomaly detection for mission-critical environments.
