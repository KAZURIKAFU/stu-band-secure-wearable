## Hardware Components

- BLE Module (for short-range secure communication)
- Proximity Sensor (presence detection)
- Microcontroller Unit (MCU)
- Power Unit (planned: Thermoelectric Generator for energy harvesting)
- Wearable Form Factor (band / badge)

## Design Considerations

- Low power consumption
- Reliable sensor readings
- Field deployability
- Minimal maintenance
